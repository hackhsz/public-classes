Application Description:

Data Relationship:
     Skillsection:Skill One:Many
     Skill: Class: Many:Many

     This is an app links the skills with skillsection and classes. Skill sections house skills. For example, 
     "UX Engineering" is a skill section which may have skills such as "HTML","CSS" and other skills.
     Class can have many skills outcomes and skills can be mapped to different classes. Because there is no necessailry relationship between classes and skillsections, classes do not have skillsection_id. Only authorized user can create class with skills (persumplively instructors and faculties)
